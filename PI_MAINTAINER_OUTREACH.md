`Package showcase request: compound-engineering-pi (Pi-first Compound Engineering workflow)`

## Suggested message

Hi Pi maintainers 👋

I built a Pi-first package that adapts the Every Compound Engineering workflow to Pi:

- Package: `compound-engineering-pi`
- Repo: https://github.com/gvkhosla/compound-engineering-pi

What it adds for Pi users:

- native Pi prompts/skills/extensions for the compound loop (`plan → work → review → compound`)
- subagent orchestration tool (`single`, `parallel`, `chain`)
- MCP interoperability via MCPorter (`mcporter_list`, `mcporter_call`)
- one-command package install in Pi (`pi install git:...` and npm path once published)

Validation notes and tests are in:
- https://github.com/gvkhosla/compound-engineering-pi/blob/main/VALIDATION.md

Would love guidance on the best path to make this discoverable as an official/community-recommended Pi package (gallery/docs/examples/Discord channel).

Thanks for building Pi 🙏
